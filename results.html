                        <h3>Kim and John Snow</h3>
                        <p>"I and my husband have been working in the gym with Steve for almost a year, and we are very happy with the results.
                        Steve helped to raise our endurance and core strength and brought our overall health and fitness to a totally new level.
                        He forces us to train with maximum potential at each workout. His set of skills, as well as the constant need for
                        training, make our sessions diverse, fresh, and rather complex. Now we feel the same way as at our first workout, and we
                        continue to progress as fast as at the beginning. Steve applies a great and motivational approach, and he can tailor his
                        program to achieve better results. He is the best we have ever worked with, and we enthusiastically recommend him to
                        anyone who want to improve their fitness and health."</p>

                        <h3>Jessica Morrison</h3>
                        <p>"Steve is a perfect personal fitness coach for people of any ages and fitness levels. I started working with Steve in
                        April 2017. He helped me to improve strength, raise endurance, and enhance my body shape. One session with Steve can be
                        compared with three sessions in the gym. I like the way he pushes me to a new level. Every session is different,
                        challenging, yet fun. I even gave up my daily weighing routine! Now I focus not on my weight but on how my clothes fit
                        me. It is amazing to wear clothes that I have not worn for a long time! Thanks, Steve!"</p>

                        "The main target in my life was to climb the mountain Kilimanjaro. I was not in shape and did not visit a gym for nearly
                        3 years. So I decided to make every effort to realize my dream. As soon as I began to train, I understood that without
                        proper support I would not go anywhere. Running and fitness didn’t mean anything if I didn’t have someone who could push
                        me to the limit, induce me to wake up and practice, and make my goal a reality. And that someone was Steve. He was
                        exactly the person I needed, a coach who will always challenge my workouts, constantly changing my daily workouts to
                        make me work at my fullest. During each workout, he inspired and motivated me to follow my dream. Thank you, Steve!"
